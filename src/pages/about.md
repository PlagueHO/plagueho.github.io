I'm a Sr. Partner Solution Architect, Data & AI @ Microsoft. I'm often called "DSR". I've spent 25+ years in tech, from dial-up days to AI-driven apps.

## üß† Tech Journey

- I started my journey with Visual Basic, C++ & FoxPro, but now thrown in with C# .NET, Node.js/TypeScript, Python and PowerShell (my CLI yoga) (and occasionally GoLang).
- Former Microsoft MVP in Cloud & Data Center.
- Co-author of the book [Azure SQL Hyperscale Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/Azure-SQL-Hyperscale-Revealed-High-performance-ebook/dp/B0BT4Q229N).
- Maintainer of [PowerShell DSC modules](https://github.com/dsccommunity) modules and [DSC community commitee member](http://dsccommunity.org/) ‚Äì open-source plumbing at its finest.

## ü§ñ AI Adventures

- Focused on Agentic AI: autonomous systems that plan, reason, and act (think Jarvis, minus the world domination).
- Passionate about Generative AI: from code to content to pizza toppings.
- Mission: empower people with AI, not replace them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps -> AIOps

- DevOps veteran turned AIOps enthusiast.
- Building self-healing, predictive systems that fix issues before they happen.
- Automating myself out of a job so I can invent the next big thing.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è SaaS & Developer Tech

- Architecting cloud-native SaaS apps on Azure.
- Co-leading the SaaS, Startups and Multitenant Architecture Review Board at Microsoft.
- Obsessed with modern Cloud and Cloud Native technologies to host all those AI enabled apps: PaaS, containers, serverless, DevSecOps.
- If it makes devs' lives easier or more productive, I'm in.

## üåè Community Builder

- Organizer & speaker at NZ tech meetups: [Aotearoa Azure Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/auckland-azure-usergroup) and [MS Copilot User Group](https://www.meetup.com/ms-copilot-user-group-of-aotearoa).
- Advocate for open-source and community-driven projects.
- Believer in ‚Äútech is a team sport‚Äù ‚Äì and that no meetup is complete without pizza or samosas.

## TL;DR

I'm a lifelong learner, AI tinkerer, cloud architect, and community cheerleader. I love sharing knowledge, automating the boring stuff, and hopefully helping people while doing it.

Let's get cognitively coding!
