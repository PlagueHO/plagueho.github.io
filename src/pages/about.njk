      <p>
        Hi, I'm Daniel Scott-Raynsford—though most folks just call me DSR! I'm a Sr. Partner Solution Architect for Data & AI at Microsoft, and my journey in tech started over 25 years ago. From the days of dial-up modems to the AI-powered apps of today, I've always been fascinated by how technology can empower people.
      </p>

      <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My first lines of code were written in Visual Basic, C++, and FoxPro. These days, you'll find me deep in C# .NET, Node.js/TypeScript, Python, and PowerShell (my go-to for CLI yoga)—and yes, I dabble in GoLang when the mood strikes. I was once a Microsoft MVP in Cloud & Data Center, and I even co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Azure-SQL-Hyperscale-Revealed-High-performance-ebook/dp/B0BT4Q229N">Azure SQL Hyperscale Revealed</a>. Open source is close to my heart: I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/dsccommunity">PowerShell DSC modules</a> and serve on the <a href="http://dsccommunity.org/">DSC community committee</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Adventures</h2>
      <p>
        These days, my passion is Agentic AI—autonomous systems that plan, reason, and act (think Jarvis, but without the world domination). I love exploring Generative AI, whether it's creating code, content, or even dreaming up new pizza toppings. My mission? To empower people with AI, not replace them.
      </p>

      <h2>From DevOps to AIOps</h2>
      <p>
        My career has taken me from Developer, to DevOps veteran to AIOps enthusiast. I thrive on building self-healing, predictive systems that fix issues before they even happen. My philosophy: automate myself out of a job so I can invent the next big thing!
      </p>

      <h2>SaaS &amp; Developer Tech</h2>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about architecting cloud-native SaaS apps on Azure and co-leading the SaaS, Startups, and Multitenant Architecture Review Board at Microsoft. Modern cloud and cloud-native technologies—PaaS, containers, serverless, DevSecOps—are my playground. If it makes developers' lives easier or more productive, I'm all in.
      </p>

      <h2>Community Builder</h2>
      <p>
        Community is everything to me. I organize and speak at NZ tech meetups like the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/auckland-azure-usergroup">Aotearoa Azure Meetup</a> and the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ms-copilot-user-group-of-aotearoa">MS Copilot User Group</a>. I'm a big believer in open source, community-driven projects, and the idea that tech is a team sport—plus, no meetup is complete without pizza or samosas!
      </p>

      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a lifelong learner, AI tinkerer, cloud architect, and community cheerleader. I love sharing knowledge, automating the boring stuff, and hopefully helping people while doing it. Let's get cognitively coding!
