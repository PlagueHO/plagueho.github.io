Happy TP5 day!

Here is just a quick snapshot of the package list for Nano Server in Windows Server 2016 TP5:

Right off the bat I notice a few new ones are included:

- **BootFromWim**
- **SecureStartup**
- **ShieldedVM**

I can guess at the purpose of these packages, but will be interested to learn a bit more about them. That is all I have time for as I now need to go and update the LabBuilder sample projects to use this new ISO.
