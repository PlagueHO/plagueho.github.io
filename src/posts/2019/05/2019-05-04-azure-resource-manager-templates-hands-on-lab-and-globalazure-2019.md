Recently I helped organize and present at the 2019 [Global Azure Bootcamp](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/) in Auckland. The Global Azure Bootcamp is an huge event run by Azure communities throughout the world all on the same day every year. It is an opportunity for anyone with an interest in Azure to come and learn from experts and presenters and share their knowledge. If you're new to Azure or even if you're an expert it is well worth your time to attend these free events.

The **Global Azure Bootcamp** is also an awful lot of fun to be a part of and I got to meet some fantastic people!

We also got to contribute to the [Global Azure Bootcamp Science lab](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/global-azure-science-lab-2019/), which was a really great way to learn Azure as well as contribute to the goal of finding potential exosolar planets (how cool is that?). A global [dashboard](https://gablabdashboard.azurewebsites.net/) was made available where all locations could compare their contributions. The Auckland Team did fantastically well, given the size of Auckland comparatively: We managed to get 8th on the [team leaderboard](https://gablabdashboard.azurewebsites.net/Results/Teams):

## Hands-On Workshop Material

As part of my session this year, I produced a **Hands-on workshop** and **presentation** showing attendees the basics of using **Azure Resource Manager templates** as well as some of the more advanced topics such as linked/nested templates and security.

The topics covered are:

I've made all of this material **open** and **free for the community** to use to run your own sessions or modify and improve.

You can find the material in GitHub here:

Thanks for reading and hope to see some of you at a future **Global Azure Bootcamp**!
