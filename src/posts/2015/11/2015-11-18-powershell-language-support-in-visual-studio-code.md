I feel like my birthday has come early: Microsoft has added [PowerShell language support in Visual Studio Code](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/11/17/announcing-windows-powershell-for-visual-studio-code-and-more.aspx):

I mainly use PowerShell ISE with [ISE Steroids](http://www.powertheshell.com/isesteroids2/) for most of my coding, but I find when I'm needing to switch between working on multiple files of different types **Visual Studio Code** is so much faster and slicker. **Visual Studio 2015** with **PoSH** tools would be the ideal way to go, but the **PoSH** extension is quite slow with any files larger than 20KB. So I'm really excited with what this can do.
