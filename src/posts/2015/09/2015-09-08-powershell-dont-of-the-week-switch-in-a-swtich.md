I just spent the last hour bashing my head against my keyboard trying to figure out what I had done wrong in one of my scripts.

It turns out when you are inside a **switch** construct, the variable `$Switch` is **redefined** (presumably by the switch construct itself) as an empty variable of type `System.Collections.IEnumerator`. The value is set to `$null`. This won't be a problem if you're not using a variable with the name `$Switch`. Unfortunately, I wasâ€”because I was working with a set of Virtual Switches, so `$Switch` seemed like a fair choice of variable name.

I could go and research further into this and find out why this is, but I just don't have time right now. If anyone else has looked into this, I'd be really interested to know why.
