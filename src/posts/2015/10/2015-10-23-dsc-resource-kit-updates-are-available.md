The Microsoft DSC Resource Kit has been updated with a bunch of new stuff. You can check this out [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/10/23/dsc-resource-kit-updates-are-here.aspx).

If you're using DSC, you're no doubt familiar with the Microsoft DSC Resource Kit as it provides some of the most useful resources available outside of the base DSC Resources. You should really go and check it out to see what sort of thing you can be configuring with DSC straight out of the box.

I'm especially proud of this release as it contains some stuff I've be contributing to outside of my own resources. I've been helping out with adding some code to the xNetworking resource.
