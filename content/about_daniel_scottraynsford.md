I am a Partner Technology Strategist at Microsoft. My passion is in helping companies build innovative Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions in the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Before my current role as a Partner Technology Strategist, I was a Cloud Solution Architect.

I have over 20 years experience developing and architecting software in a wide range of technologies, from .NET, Node.JS/TypeScript, Python, GoLang and of course PowerShell.

Before joining Microsoft I spent 3 years as a Microsoft MVP in Cloud and Data Center technologies. I am a passionate contributor to Open Source, focusing on PowerShell and PowerShell DSC, but covering many other areas as well. I am a community maintainer of many [PowerShell DSC modules](https://github.com/dsccommunity) for the [DSC community](http://dsccommunity.org/).

I am a regular speaker at user groups and events and help organize the [Aotearoa Azure Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/auckland-azure-usergroup) in Aotearoa (New Zealand).

I am a co-author of the book [Azure SQL Hyperscale Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/Azure-SQL-Hyperscale-Revealed-High-performance-ebook/dp/B0BT4Q229N).

My current passions are in Large-Language Models and GPT and how they can be used to empower all. I'm also focused on deepening my understanding of Machine Learning. I'm also working on building distributed applications using Blazor.NET, Python and DAPR within Azure Container Instances.
