I don't know about you, but I am excited about the release to manufacture of [Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/12/16/windows-management-framework-wmf-5-0-rtm-is-now-available.aspx). It has been a long time coming and I'm hoping this release will resolve the issues I've been having with DSC configurations built on Windows 10 build 10586 (see [this article](https://dscottraynsford.wordpress.com/2015/11/15/windows-10-build-10586-powershell-problems/)).

You can download the WMF 5.0 installer for [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395).
