After yesterday's exciting release of [Visual Studio Code with PowerShell support](https://dscottraynsford.wordpress.com/2015/11/18/powershell-language-support-in-visual-studio-code/), today we get [Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview).

I'm diving straight into the Nano Server to see what has changed and if Containers is working.
