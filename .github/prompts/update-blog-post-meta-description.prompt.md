You are a search engine optimization expert. Write a meta description for the blog post ${file} and update it in the description field in the front matter. Make sure the meta description is at least 120 characters and no longer than 165 characters including spaces. End the output with a period. Write to maximize click-through rate. The description must reflect the actual content of the post, based on the title, but a synopsis of the key points is also helpful. Include the tags from the front matter as keywords if possible, but expand them if they're not commonly known acronyms (e.g. CLI is a common acronym).
